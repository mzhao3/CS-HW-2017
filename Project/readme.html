After logging in through the log in page, you are brought to the main page. If you click the quizzes page, you are brought to a quiz selection page, where you can take one of three quizzes. If you finish all the questions, click the "finish" button to submit your results. The trivia quiz tells you how many questions you got right, and the answers you got wrong. The character quiz links to four different character pages. You can also click on the blog tab, and are brought to a submission form. Type a comment into the box and click submit! The info page is for decoration, since 4 is a pretty good number.
