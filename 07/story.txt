A $person1$ and $person2$  once upon a time reigned in a country a $adjective3$ way off, where there were in those days fairies. Now this $person1$ and $person2$  had plenty of money, and plenty of fine clothes to wear, and plenty of
good things to eat and drink, and a coach to ride out in every day: but
though they had been married many years they had no children, and this
grieved them very much indeed. But one day as the $person2$  was walking
by the side of the river, at the bottom of the garden, she saw a poor
little fish, that had thrown itself out of the water, and lay gasping
and nearly dead on the bank. Then the $person2$  took pity on the little
fish, and threw it back again into the river; and before it swam away
it lifted its head out of the water and said, 'I know what your wish is,
and it shall be $past-tense-verb1$, in return for your kindness to me--you will soon have a daughter.' What the little fish had foretold soon came to
pass; and the $person2$  had a little girl, so very $adjective1$ that the king
could not cease looking on it for joy, and said he would hold a great
feast and make merry, and show the child to all the land. So he asked
his kinsmen, and nobles, and friends, and neighbours. But the $person2$ 
said, 'I will have the fairies also, that they might be kind and good
to our little daughter.' Now there were $number1$ fairies in the kingdom;
but as the $person1$ and $person2$  had only $number2$ golden dishes for them to eat out of, they were forced to leave one of the fairies without asking her.
So $number2$ fairies came, each with a high red cap on her head, and red
shoes with high heels on her feet, and a long white wand in her hand:
and after the feast was over they gathered round in a ring and gave all
their best gifts to the little princess. One $past-tense-verb2$ her goodness, another beauty, another riches, and so on till she had all that was good in the world.

Just as eleven of them had done $-ing-verb1$ her, a great noise was heard in
the courtyard, and word was brought that the thirteenth fairy was
come, with a $adjective2$ cap on her head, and $adjective2$ shoes on her feet, and a broomstick in her hand: and presently up she came into the dining-hall.
Now, as she had not been asked to the feast she was very angry, and
scolded the $person1$ and $person2$  very much, and set to work to take her
revenge. So she cried out, 'The $person1$'s daughter shall, in her fifteenth
year, be wounded by a spindle, and fall down dead.' Then the twelfth of
the friendly fairies, who had not yet given her gift, came forward, and
said that the evil wish must be fulfilled, but that she could soften its
mischief; so her gift was, that the $person1$'s daughter, when the spindle
wounded her, should not really die, but should only fall asleep for a
hundred years.

However, the $person1$ hoped still to save his dear child altogether from
the threatened evil; so he ordered that all the spindles in the kingdom
should be bought up and burnt. But all the gifts of the first eleven
fairies were in the meantime fulfilled; for the princess was so
beautiful, and well behaved, and good, and wise, that everyone who knew
her loved her.

It happened that, on the very day she was fifteen years old, the $person1$
and $person2$  were not at home, and she was left alone in the palace. So she
roved about by herself, and looked at all the rooms and chambers, till
at last she came to an old tower, to which there was a narrow staircase
ending with a little door. In the door there was a golden key, and when
she turned it the door sprang open, and there sat an old lady $-ing-verb2$
away very busily. 'Why, how now, good mother,' said the princess; 'what
are you doing there?' '$-ing-verb2$,' said the old lady, and nodded her
head, $-ing-verb3$ a tune, while buzz! went the wheel. 'How prettily that
little thing turns round!' said the princess, and took the spindle
and began to try and spin. But scarcely had she touched it, before the
fairy's prophecy was fulfilled; the spindle $past-tense-verb3$ her, and she fell down lifeless on the ground.

However, she was not dead, but had only fallen into a deep sleep; and
the $person1$ and the $person2$ , who had just come home, and all their court,
fell asleep too; and the horses slept in the stables, and the dogs in
the court, the pigeons on the house-top, and the very flies slept upon
the walls. Even the fire on the hearth left off blazing, and went to
sleep; the jack stopped, and the spit that was turning about with a
goose upon it for the $person1$'s dinner stood still; and the cook, who was
at that moment pulling the kitchen-boy by the hair to give him a box
on the ear for something he had done amiss, let him go, and both fell
asleep; the butler, who was slyly tasting the ale, fell asleep with the
jug at his lips: and thus everything stood still, and slept soundly.
